                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript </li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript </li>
            </ul>

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                    different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                    does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
                    any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                    to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
                    your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");
                </code>
                <p>
                    Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                    browser!

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
                    syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                    generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                    variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
                    syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
                    Variable scope below.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                    is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                    scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                    function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
                    example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
                    function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                    block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                  <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015.
