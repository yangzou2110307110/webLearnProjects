      <h2>What is ASCII?</h2>
      <p>ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard
        for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other
        devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional
        characters.<br />

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>ASCII was developed from telegraph code. Its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code
        promoted
        by Bell data services. Work on the ASCII standard began in May 1961, with the first meeting of the American
        Standards Association's (ASA) (now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee. The
        first edition of the standard was published in 1963, underwent a major revision during 1967, and
        experienced its most recent update during 1986. Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code
        and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists and added features
        for devices other than teleprinters.<br />
